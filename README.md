SLOT MACHINE JACKPOT!!!
Hopefully, you get to win the super jackpot so you can go on a shopping spree for the holidays.

User Stories:

1. As a player, I want to see what the jackpot is so I am excited to play
   a. I also want to see a distinct signal when I get all 3 to match
2. As a player, I want there to be a few result types so that the game is challenging
3. As a player, the button to press to get the machine started should be obviously shown
   a. Minimal learning curve for a simple single player game

Technologies Used:
HTML: The HTML was used to create the landing page for the slot machine as well as create a variety of headers and some buttons to make the game more interactive. Hopefully, the audio puts the user in the winning mood!

CSS: I wanted to make my slot machine have Christmas colors as well as be visually intuitive to the user.

JavaScript: Since the game is Christmas themed, I chose relevant emojis to make things festive as well as created game rules to make only a certain condition the winning one. An array shows the available emojis with correct methods making sure that the emojis are drawn at random.

Next Steps:
For this MVP, 3 emojis is managable though I can increase number to approximately 5 to make the game more difficult for the user.
Smooth out the spinning feature for each slot box.
Add more sounds to keep the game exciting to the player.
Make the jackpot a changing number and add a score counter.
Other code that is scaleable to other holidays such as Valentines, 4th of July, etc.
Will likely want to incorporate mobiile-first design though I imagine the majority of users would want to play a slot machine on a full browser?
