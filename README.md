# Technologies Used:

Front-end: HTML/CSS/JS

HTML: The HTML was used to create the landing page for the slot machine as well as create a variety of headers and some buttons to make the game more interactive. Hopefully, the audio puts the user in the winning mood!

CSS: I wanted to make my slot machine have Christmas colors as well as be visually intuitive to the user.

JavaScript: Since the game is Christmas themed, I chose relevant emojis to make things festive as well as created game rules to make only a certain condition the winning one. An array shows the available emojis with correct methods making sure that the emojis are drawn at random.

# Next Steps

1. Increase the amount of emojis available as well as slots
2. Add more CSS such as the slots' spinning motion
3. Make the game more audibly enjoyable such as by adding more Christmas music
4. Add a score tracker so the player knows how many tries it took to achieve the winning condition
5. Make the game more mobile friendly
6. Make the game compatible across all browsers such as audio files in Chrome
