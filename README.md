Hopefully, you get to win the super jackpot so you can go on a shopping spree for the holidays.

☐ Technologies Used:
HTML: The HTML was used to create the landing page for the slot machine as well as create a variety of headers and some buttons to make the game more interactive.

CSS: I wanted to make my slot machine have Christmas colors.

JavaScript: Since the game is Christmas themed, I chose relevant emojis to make things festive as well as created game rules to make only a certain condition the winning one.

☐ Next Steps: 
Smooth out the spinning feature for each slot box. 
Add more sounds to keep the game exciting to the player.
